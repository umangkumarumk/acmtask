Idea is taken from internet also some of complex coding part is also taken from internet but new features are added by me such as variety of arithmetic 
questions(+,-,/)as original only had multiplication,score decrement on wrong answer,precission for decimal value,new question after giving a wrong answer,
position of timer,colors and containers etc.
